omnisharp-emacs is a port of the awesome [omnisharp-roslyn][] server to the
Emacs text editor. It provides IDE-like features for editing files in
C# solutions in Emacs, provided by an OmniSharp server instance that
works in the background.

See [omnisharp-emacs Features](doc/features.md).

## Installation of the omnisharp-roslyn server application
This emacs package requires the [omnisharp-roslyn][] server program.

You have three options here:
  * You can use M-x `omnisharp-install-server` to install omnisharp-server binary automatically. 

    * *NOTE: On Windows, this command requires PowerShell v5+ to be installed
      â€“ see [omnisharp-emacs#275](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-emacs/issues/275).*

    * *NOTE 2*: On macOS and Linux omnisharp server binary requires
      [mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) to be installed on your system.

  * Download and extract server binaries
    manually and then point `omnisharp-server-executable-path` variable to the binary.

  * Build the server yourself from the source. 
    Building instructions are detailed in 
    [omnisharp-roslyn building page](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn#building).

### Manual installation on macOS with brew
<pre>
brew install omnisharp/omnisharp-roslyn/omnisharp-mono
</pre>

Then you need to set the `omnisharp-server-executable-path`:

```lisp
(setq omnisharp-server-executable-path "/usr/local/bin/omnisharp")
```

### Manual installation on Linux
Extract binary from [omnisharp-roslyn releases page](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/releases).

Then you need to set the `omnisharp-server-executable-path`:

```lisp
(setq omnisharp-server-executable-path "<path-to-server-wrapper-script>")
```

### Manual installation on Windows (non-Cygwin)
Use binary from [omnisharp-roslyn releases page](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/releases).

*NOTE: For the moment you HAVE to use the `omnisharp-win-x86-net46.zip` bundle as -x64- one makes emacs
to crash in `src/w32proc.c:w32_executable_type`.* See https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-emacs/issues/315

Then you need to set the `omnisharp-server-executable-path` the path
to where you have extracted server file, e.g.:

```lisp
(setq omnisharp-server-executable-path "C:\\Bin\\omnisharp-roslyn\\OmniSharp.exe")
```

### Manual installation on windows (with Cygwin)
Use binary from [omnisharp-roslyn releases page](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/releases):

 - https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/releases/download/v1.9-beta22/omnisharp-win-x64-net46.zip
 
If I use omnisharp-roslyn net46 directly, omnisharp-emacs hangs when interacting via stdio.
This seems to be a difference in how console IO is handled in newer versions of .Net.
My workaround involves using a wrapper written in C#:

https://gist.github.com/corngood/d982c3c21c016127a2f1600dc895c000

You need to compile the wrapper against an older .net framework (3.5 seems to work). A simple way to use the wrapper is to create a shell script like:

```shell
#!/bin/sh
set -e
[path-to-wrapper-exe] "$(cygpath -w [path-to-omnisharp-exe])" "$@"
```

If you name this script OmniSharp, and put it in your path (e.g. /usr/local/bin/OmniSharp),
`omnisharp-emacs` should find it and launch omnisharp correctly.
Or you can point to it directly in your init.el

```lisp
(setq omnisharp-server-executable-path "/home/<username>/bin/OmniSharp")
```

## Package Installation and Configuration
This package requires Emacs 24.3 and above. It has been tested on
Ubuntu, Windows 7+ and on macOS.

### Installation on Spacemacs
Add `csharp` layer to `dotspacemacs-configuration-layers` on
your `.spacemacs` file. `csharp-mode` and `omnisharp` packages
will get installed automatically on restart for you.

 * TODO: as of 2017-02-19 `csharp` layer installs non-roslyn version of omnisharp-emacs.

### Installation on Regular Emacs
To install, use [MELPA][].
After MELPA is configured correctly, use

<pre>
M-x package-refresh-contents RET
M-x package-install omnisharp RET
</pre>
to install.

When installing the `omnisharp` package `package.el` will also 
automatically pull in `csharp-mode` for you as well.

To automatically load omnisharp-emacs when editing csharp files, add
something like this to `csharp-mode-hook` on your `init.el`:

```
(add-hook 'csharp-mode-hook 'omnisharp-mode)
```

## Configuration and commands available
To start it, use `M-x omnisharp-start-omnisharp-server RET`.
The command will ask you for a solution file or a directory 
you want to code in.

Emacs will manage connection to the server as a subprocess.

You will probably want to create a custom configuration for accessing
omnisharp-emacs in your normal coding sessions. There is an example
configuration for evil-mode included in the project.
